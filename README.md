## Vintrace Coding Challenge

## Hi Zane


### first clone the repo to a new folder

## Excercise 1

### cd into "Vintrace/Vintrace_API" and type "npm run start" to start server
  - now if you go to your web browser paste "http://localhost:8080/{any routes as requested in Excercise 1}"
  
  - you should be able to see the JSON data as requested.
  
## Excercise 2

### cd into vintrace_react_app and do an "npm install"

## then type "npm start" to run the react app

 - you should now be able to search the "lotCodes" in the provided "Search Bar" and see that you are getting the correct JSON data in the console from this call
 
 - unfortunately this is where I got stuck and I am still working to resolve the rest of this challenge.
